# Inferring computational neuroscience ranking from computer science and neuroscience rankings

## 1. US News, Best Global Universities for Subjects

I extracted top 120 universities from the 2 list of 'computer science' and 'neuroscience and behavior'.
From those lists, I gathered subject scores, summed those scores, and used the summed scores as the criterion for a ranking of computational neuroscience (CompNeuro).
I know this is a controversial criterion but there is no ranking for CompNeuro in public.
I believe that
if universities are good at both computer science and neuroscience, 
they are willing to build research organizations for CompNeuro, and have a number of CompNeuro experts.
